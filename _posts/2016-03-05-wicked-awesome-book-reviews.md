I started Wicked Awesome Reviews in January of 2016 and have since found that my main focus has been on book reviews.  Now, this may or may not have to do with the fact that I have been a reading fool lately.  As the year progresses you may see that I slow down on the reading and pick up on the movie watching!  In any case, I have a lot to say about books lately and I hope you enjoy!

I love to read in many genres including, but certainly not limited to; True Crime, Mystery/Thriller, Horror, Historical Fiction, Biography/Memoir, etc.  I am not into romance/erotic novels, though I have read one historical romance that I enjoyed....just don't get too lovey dovey on me!  I am pretty much open to any other genres.  A good book is a good book!!

As with many book lovers, I have always owned more books than I could possibly read! Owning a kindle has not helped that one bit! Especially when there are free or deeply discounted books to be had!  Moving from Massachusetts to Georgia helped a little...I donated a LOT of books to the Goodwill and Salvation Army! I try to keep track of it all on goodreads.  I am a daily user of goodreads.com but I have stopped trying to put together an order in which these books will be read!  Other than trying to fit in a book club read during the right month, I usually don't know what book I'm going to read next until the day I start reading it!  Even then, I might read the first few pages of 4 or 6 books before I decide!

I usually write a review the day I finish a book but there are times when I feel the need to "sleep on it."  It is rare that I go more that 24 hours though.  I will always try to stress the positive and avoid the negative.  If I don't like a book I will tell you why but will not go on a rant!  No one needs a rant to understand that a book is not good!  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0de86ec3-272e-4f0b-961f-e20aba591a96.jpg)

I will be moving content to this site over the next few weeks.  I look forward to an amzing Grid experience!  In the mean time...Happy Reading!
