**Wicked Awesome Book Review**

OK, this was a fun mystery! Read it in less than 48 hours and really had a

good time! I even had a dream about it last night! I am looking forward to 

reading more in the series! It kind of reminds me of Janet Evanovich's 

Stephanie Plum series. Fun read and a good twist. I thought for sure I had it 

figured out at about 75% through but I was sooo wrong!!

This is a quick read, a good twist, and funny. Great for when you are looking 

to just relax and read and not think too much! I really think Stephanie Plum 

fans would like this series. It's got that same sort of lighthearted nature, a 

little sexual tension and some silliness!

I received this Random House Monthly Mystery for free from Chatterbox 

by Houseparty in exchange for an honest review! Thank you Caroline 

Fardig and Netgalley for making this available! \#RHMysteryPack
